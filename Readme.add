📌 Project Overview

This project implements a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve the classic 8-Queens problem, where the objective is to place eight queens on a chessboard such that no two queens attack each other. The solution is obtained by evolving a population of candidate solutions using genetic operators.

🧠 Problem Description

The 8-Queens problem is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem. Each queen must be placed in a unique row and column, and no two queens can share the same diagonal. Traditional brute-force approaches are inefficient, making evolutionary algorithms a suitable alternative.

⚙️ Methodology

The Genetic Algorithm works by:

-Generating a random initial population

-Evaluating fitness based on non-attacking queen pairs

-Selecting parents using tournament selection

-Producing offspring using crossover

-Introducing variation through mutation

Preserving elite solutions for faster convergence

🧪 Algorithm Parameters

-Board Size (N): 8

-Population Size: 100

-Mutation Rate: 0.1

-Maximum Generations: 1000

-Selection Method: Tournament Selection

-Crossover Type: Order-based crossover

-Elitism: Top 10 individuals preserved

▶️ How to Run the Code

-Ensure Python is installed on your system.

-Copy the code into a .py file (e.g., eight_queens_ga.py).

-Run the file using: python eight_queens_ga.py

-The solution and generation number will be displayed in the console.
✅ Output

The program outputs a valid arrangement of queens represented as a list, where the index indicates the column and the value indicates the row of a queen. It also displays the generation number in which the solution was found.

📊 Conclusion

The experiment confirms that Genetic Algorithms are effective for solving constraint-based optimization problems like the 8-Queens problem. By combining selection, crossover, mutation, and elitism, the algorithm converges efficiently toward an optimal solution.
